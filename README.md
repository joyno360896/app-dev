# Star Wars Prequel Era

*The era of Anakin Skywalker's origin, the height of the Jedi Order, and the creation of the Galactic Empire. It's rich with political intrigue and epic galactic war.*

**This era is primarily defined by the three prequel films (Episodes I, II, and III) and the events of the three-year-long Clone Wars.**

*The core trio*

1. Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader
2. Obi-Wan Kenobi
3. Padmé Amidala
